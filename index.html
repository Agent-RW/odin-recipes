      If you're anything like me, the thought of spending any longer than 10
      minutes preparing a meal feels like a bigger waste than coughing up half a
      day's worth of earnings for crappy take-out and fast food. Together we
      must abandon such naive and foolish notions. For starters, you're not
      making any

      in under 20 minutes. Such silly expectations only go to show that you
      haven't seriously sat down and considered what skills or simple dishes

      Robo Chef is here to shield you from some of the stress associated with
      having to plan and prepare meals. Once you've stepped foot in the kitchen
      and attempted to cook a <strong>meal</strong> you will realize the
      actually difficult part of cooking. I'll give you a hint, it isn't turning
      on the burner. When you are unexperienced in the baron lands of a single
      young adults kitchen, just figuring out what you can make and how is
      difficult.
